## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Divisible by 9

## AIM  
To write a Python program to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by 9 or not using  if else.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take integer input from the user
3. Check if the number is divisible by 9.
4. If it's divisible by 9, display "is divisible by 9"
5. Otherwise, display "is not divisible by 9"
6.. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060196
# Name-Peter Ambrose B

a=int(input())
if(a%9==0):
 print(f"{a} is divisible by 9")
else:
    print(f"{a} is NOT divisible by 9")
    
```
